        <p><img id="history-1" src="images/history-image-1.jpg">Historically, many cultures in continental Africa developed
        hairstyles that defined status, or identity, in regards to age,
        ethnicity, wealth, social rank, marital status, religion, fertility,
        adulthood, and death. Hair was carefully groomed by those who
        understood the aesthetic standard, as the social implications of
        hair grooming were a significant part of community life. Dense, thick,
        clean, and neatly groomed hair was something highly admired and sought
        after. Hair groomers possessed unique styling skills, allowing them to
        create a variety of designs that met the local cultural standards.
        Hair was usually dressed according to local culture.</p>

          In many traditional cultures, communal grooming was a social event
          when a woman could socialize and strengthen bonds between herself,
          other women and their families. Historically, hair braiding was not
          a paid trade. Since the African diaspora, in the 20th and 21st centuries
          it has developed as a multimillion-dollar business in such regions as
          the United States, South Africa and western Europe. An individual’s hair
          groomer was usually someone whom they knew closely. Sessions can include
          shampooing, oiling, combing, braiding and twisting, plus adding accessories.
          For shampooing, black soap was widely used in nations in West and Central
          Africa. Additionally, palm oil and palm kernel oil were popularly used for
          oiling the scalp. Shea butter has traditionally been used to moisturize and
          dress the hair.

          <h4>Politics of Black hair</h4>
          <p>In 1960s United States, natural afro-textured hair was transformed from a
          simple expression of style into a revolutionary political statement. It became
          a fundamental tool of the Black movement in America, and “hair came to symbolize
          either a continued move toward integration in the American political system or a
          growing cry for Black power and nationalism.” Prior to this, the idealized Black
          person (especially Black women) “had many Eurocentric features, including hairstyles.”
          However, during the movement, the Black community endeavored to define their own
          ideals and beauty standards, and hair became a central icon which was “promoted as
          a way of challenging mainstream standards regarding hair”.[14]:35 During this time,
          afro-textured hair “was at its height of politicization”, and wearing an Afro was an
          easily distinguishable physical expression of Black pride and the rejection of societal
          norms. Jesse Jackson, a political activist, says that “the way [he] wore [his] hair was
          an expression of the rebellion of the time”. Black activists infused straightened hair
          with political valence; straightening one’s hair in an attempt to ‘simulate Whiteness’,
          whether chemically or with the use of heat, came to be seen by some as an act of
          self-hatred and a sign of internalized oppression imposed by White-dominated mainstream
          media. <img id="history-2" src="images/history-image-2.jpg">
          <br><br>At this time, an African-American person’s “ability to conform to mainstream
          standards of beauty [was] tied to being successful.” Thus, rejecting straightened hair
          symbolized a deeper act of rejecting the belief that straightening hair and other forms
          of grooming which were deemed ‘socially acceptable’ were the only means of looking
          presentable and attaining success in society. The pressing comb and chemical straighteners
          became stigmatized within the community as symbols of oppression and imposed White beauty ideals.
          Certain Black people sought to embrace beauty and affirm and accept their natural physical traits.
          One of the ultimate goals of the Black movement was to evolve to a level where Black people
          “were proud of black skin and kinky or nappy hair. As a result, natural hair became a symbol of
          that pride.”Negative perceptions of afro-textured hair and beauty had been passed down through
          the generations, so they had become ingrained in Black mentality to the point where they had been
          accepted as simple truths. Wearing natural hair was seen as a progressive statement, and for all
          the support that the movement gathered, there were many who opposed natural hair both for its
          aesthetics and the ideology that it promoted. It caused tensions between the Black and White
          communities, as well as discomfort amongst more conservative African-Americans.</p>

          <div id="history-paragraph-4">
            <h4 class="subtitle">African-Americans.</h4>
            <p> <img id="history-3" src="images/history-image-3.jpg">The style of afro-textured hair continues to be politicized in contemporary society.
            “These issues of style are highly charged as sensitive questions about very ‘identity’.”
            Whether an individual decides to wear their hair in its natural state or alter it, all Black
            hairstyles convey a message. In several post-colonial societies, the value system promotes
            ‘white bias’, and “ethnicities are valorized according to the tilt of whiteness—[which] functions
            as the ideological basis for status ascription.” In turn, in this value system, “African elements—be
            they cultural or physical—are devalued as indices of low social status, while European elements
            are positively valorized as attributes enabling individual upward mobility”. This value system is
            reinforced by the systematic racism that was, and still is, often hidden from the public eye in
            Western society. Racism ‘works’ by encouraging the devaluation of self-identity by the victims themselves,
            and that re-centering of a sense of pride is a prerequisite for a politics of resistance and reconstruction.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="history-paragraph-5">
          <p>In this system, “hair functions as a key ‘ethnic signifier’ because, compared with bodily shape or facial
          features, it can be changed more easily by cultural practices such as straightening.” Racism originally
          “’politicized’ [afro-textured] hair by burdening it with a range of negative social and psychological ‘meanings’”
          —categorizing it as a problem. 37 Ethnic difference that could be easily manipulated, like hair, was altered in
          order for ethnic minorities to assimilate into a dominant, Eurocentric society. Natural hairstyles, such as the
          Afro and dreadlocks, “counter-politicized the signifier of ethnic devalorization, redefining Blackness as a
          positive attribute”. By wearing their hair as it naturally grows, individuals with afro-textured hair were taking
          back agency in deciding the value and politics of their own hair. Wearing one’s hair naturally also opens up a
          new debate: Are those who decide to still wear their hair straightened, for example, less ‘Black’ or ‘proud’ of
          their heritage, than those who decide to wear their hair naturally? This debate is an often-ongoing topic of
          discussion within the community. The issue is highly debated and disputed, creating almost a social divide within
          the community between those who decide to be natural and those who do not.</p>

          <div id="history-paragraph-5">
            <h4>Rise of Black pride</h4>
            <p>African-American hair has been through many different cycles. Slavery played a major role in the ups and downs
            of the pride that African-Americans take in their hair. “Everything I knew about American history I learned from
            looking at Black people’s hair. It’s the perfect metaphor for the African experiment here: the price of the ticket,
            the toll of slavery, and the costs remaining. It’s all in the hair. Like Jamaica Kincaid, who writes only about a
            character named Mother, I’ve decided to write only about hair: what we do to it, how we do it, and why. I figure
            this is enough”, said Lisa Jones in an essay titled Hair Always and Forever.</p>

            In the United States, the successes of the civil rights movement, and the Black power and Black pride movements of
            the 1960s and 1970s, inspired African-Americans to express their political commitments by adopting more traditionally
            African styles. The Afro hairstyle developed as an affirmation of Black African heritage, expressed by the phrase,
            “Black is beautiful.” Angela Davis wore her Afro as a political statement and started a movement toward natural hair.
            This movement influenced a generation, including celebrities like Diana Ross, whose Jheri curls took over the 1980s.

            Since the late 20th century, Black people have experimented with a variety of styles, including cornrows, locks, braiding,
            hair twists and short, cropped hair, specifically designed for afro-textured hair. Natural hair blogs include Black Girl Long
            Hair (BGLH), Curly Nikki and Afro Hair Club. With the emergence of hip-hop culture and Jamaican influences like reggae music,
            more non-Black people have begun to wear these hairstyles as well. A new market has developed in such hair products as
            “Out of Africa” shampoo.
            The popularity of natural hair has waxed and waned. In the early 21st century, a significant percentage of African-American
            women still straighten their hair with relaxers of some kind (either heat- or chemical-based). This is done despite the fact
            that prolonged application of such chemicals (or heat) can result in overprocessing, breakage and thinning of the hair. Rooks
            (1996) argues that hair-care products designed to straighten hair, which have been marketed by white-owned companies in African
            American publications since the 1830s, represent unrealistic and unattainable standards of beauty.
            Sales of relaxers took a great fall among African-American women from 2010 to 2015. Many African-American women gave up relaxers
            to go back to their natural roots. Celebrities like Esperanza Spalding, Janelle Monáe and Solange Knowles have played with natural
            hair looks. During the same time period, the number of natural-hair support groups has increased. Research has shown that relaxer
            sales dropped from $206 million in 2008 to $156 million in 2013. Meanwhile, sales of products for styling natural hair continued to
            rise. Chris Rock’s documentary Good Hair has shown what many women go through to achieve the “European standard” of hair. “Weaves
            that cost thousands of dollars and relaxers that take way too much time. Black woman has finally decided that it was simply too much”,
            according to the documentary.

          <h3 class="subtitle">Modern Perceptions and Controversies</h3>
            <div id="history-paragraph-5">
            <p>Black hairstyles have been utilized to promote the idea of identity in the Black community. Though this expression of identity has been
            joyful for the community, it is not celebrated as much in American culture. There have been numerous events in history that have shown
            disapproval of Black hair styles, some of which have transcended into present day. Black hairstyles that are straight and more reserved
            seem to be the more accepted styles. Other hair styles may face scrutiny due to their vast difference to the White beauty idealistic hair.
            The idea of accommodating this White beauty ideal has a strong presence in everyday life, but more specifically the workplace
            In 1981 Dorothy Reed, a reporter for KGO-TV, the ABC affiliate in San Francisco, was suspended for wearing her hair in cornrows with beads
            on the ends. KGO called her hairstyle “inappropriate and distracting”. After two weeks of a public dispute, an NAACP demonstration outside
            of the station, and negotiations, Reed and the station reached an agreement. The company paid her lost salary, and she removed the colored
            beads. She returned to the air, still braided, but beadless.
            The Kenyan model Ajuma Nasenyana has criticized a trend in her native Kenya that rejects the indigenous Black African physical standards of
            beauty in favour of those of other communities. In a 2012 interview with the Kenyan broadsheet the Daily Nation, she said,</p>
            </div>
            <div id="history-quote">
            <p><img id="history-4" src="images/history-image-4.jpg">“It seems that the world is conspiring in preaching that there is something wrong with Kenyan ladies’ kinky hair and dark skin…
            Their leaflets are all about skin lightening, and they seem to be doing good business in Kenya. It just shocks me. It’s not OK
            for a Caucasian to tell us to lighten our skin … I have never attempted to change my skin. I am natural. People in Europe and
            America love my dark skin. But here in Kenya, in my home country, some consider it not attractive.”</p>
            </div>
            <div id="history-paragraph-6">
              <p>In 2014, Stacia L. Brown relieves her story of feeling anxious about how her hair was styled prior to walking in for a job
              interview in her article, My Hair, My Politics. Stacia begins her story describing her “Big Chop”, a phrase used to indicate
              cutting off the relaxed or processed hair. A couple months after her big chop, she entered the Job market and she became very
              nervous about how her hair would appear to job interviewers. Luckily, none of the interviewers acknowledged her hair in a
              discriminating way. Stacia later discussed the first appearance of “the bush” in being a political statement and related it to
              her situation, worried that her hair could be seen as a “professional liability”. Then she made a comparison between her natural
              hair, which is easier to style, and her relaxed hair, which is more accepted. Stacia also incorporated examples of workplace
              discrimination toward Black hair styles. She recalls how, “the Congressional Black Caucus took the U.S. military to task for its
              grooming policies, which barred cornrows, twists, and dreadlocks.” Stacia follows up with another example from the same year in
              which the Transportation Security Administration has “come under fire for disproportionately patting down black women’s
              hair—especially their Afros.” She continues saying how, “It’s a practice TSA only agreed to stop a few months ago, when the
              agency reached an agreement with ACLU of Northern California, which had filed a complaint in 2012.”
              The perception of afro-textured hair, in the eyes of one with this hair type, may prefer to style their hair in a way that
              accentuates their racial background or they may conform to a more European hair style.
              In 2016, the article, Beauty as violence: ‘beautiful’ hair and the cultural violence of identity erasure, discussed a study
              that was conducted at a South African University using 159 African female students. They had to look at 20 pictures of various
              styles of Afro-textured hair and categorized these styles as one of four types: African Natural Hair, Braided African Natural Hair,
              African Natural Augmented Braid, and European/Asian Hairstyles. The results showed that “only, 15.1% of respondents identified the
              category of African natural hair as beautiful.” Braided natural hair had 3.1%, braided natural augmented hair had 30.8%, and
              European/Asian hair had 51%. Toks Oyedemi, author of this article, speaks on these findings as, “evidences the cultural violence of
              symbolic indoctrination that involves the perception of beautiful hair as mainly of a European/Asian texture and style and has
              created a trend where this type of hair is associated with being beautiful and preferable to other hair texture, in this instance,
              natural African hair.” This article, shows the unfortunate and telling truth of how African girls feel about their own hair, a
              perception that demonstrates a lack of self acceptance.</p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">In Other Diasporic Black Populations</h3>
            <p>During the 19th century, throughout the West Indies, the teachings of Jamaican political leader Marcus Garvey encouraged an active
            rejection of European standards of beauty. The resulting Rastafari movement of the 20th century has maintained that the growth of
            freeform dreadlocks is related to spiritual enlightenment, largely informed by the Biblical Nazirite oath. The Rastafari movement
            has been so influential in the visibility and subsequent popularity of dreadlocks, throughout the Caribbean and in the global African
            diaspora, that the term “rasta” has become synonymous with a dreadlocked individual. Today, dreadlocks are common among Afro-Caribbeans
             and Afro-Latin Americans.</p>
