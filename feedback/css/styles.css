  <h1>Feedback Notes</h1>
  <h2>feedback Rachel Zemser</h2>
  -	I love the concept and the images!
  -	In the first pair, the text is too close to the border (all of them)
  o	The black text for the screen is kind of illegible
  o	Text for the phone could be a little bolder because of small space it is taking up
  -	Wicked Witch
  o	The text for the screen looks too condensed to the corner
  ï‚§	Maybe if you go into photoshop and darken the background, you can make the text run across over the witch
  o	Same goes for the phone screen
  -	The last pair
  o	The text needs to have more leading and seems condensed in the wide screen
  o	Shift image a little to the left
  o	The text for the phone is a little hard to read
  -	Overall, it looks pretty good, but the text itself is a little hard to read, so maybe using a bolder typeface could help with that
