  <h1>Feedback Notes</h1>
  <h2>feedback for Rachel Zemser</h2>
  -	I love the concept and the images!<br><br>
  -	In the first pair, the text is too close to the border (all of them)<br><br>
  o	The black text for the screen is kind of illegible<br><br>
  o	Text for the phone could be a little bolder because of small space it is taking up<br><br>
  -	Wicked Witch<br><br>
  o	The text for the screen looks too condensed to the corner<br><br>
  o	Maybe if you go into photoshop and darken the background, you can make the text run across over the witch<br><br>
  o	Same goes for the phone screen<br><br>
  -	The last pair<br><br>
  o	The text needs to have more leading and seems condensed in the wide screen<br><br>
  o	Shift image a little to the left<br><br>
  o	The text for the phone is a little hard to read<br><br>
  -	Overall, it looks pretty good, but the text itself is a little hard to read, so maybe using a bolder typeface could help with that
