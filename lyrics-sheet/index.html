    <h1>Break My Heart Again</h1>

    <div id="verse1">
      <p>[Verse 1]<br>
      Hey, you<br>
      I'm just now leaving<br>
      Can I come around later on this evening?<br>
      Or do you need time?<br>
      Yes, of course, that's fine
      </div>

      <div id="verse2">

      [Verse 2]<br>
      Hey, you<br>
      Good morning<br>
      I'm sure you're busy now, why else would you ignore me?<br>
      Or do you need space?<br>
      You can't help it if your mind has changed<br>
      </div>

      <div class="chorus">
      <br>
      [Chorus]<br>
      So go ahead and break my heart again<br>
      Leave me wonderin' why the hell I ever let you in<br>
      Or am I? <br>
      Oh, it must be nice<br>
      To love someone who lets you break them twice<br>
      </div>

      <div id="verse3">
      <br>
      [Verse 3]<br>
      You're so blue<br>
      Are you still breathing?<br>
      Won't you tell me if you found that deeper meaning<br>
      Do you think I've gone blind?<br>
      I know it's not the truth when you say, "I'm fine"<br>
      <br>
      </div>

      <div class="chorus">
      [Chorus]<br>
      So go ahead and break my heart again<br>
      Leave me wonderin' why the hell I ever let you in<br>
      Are you the definition of insanity?<br>
      Or am I?<br>
      Oh, it must be nice<br>
      To love someone who lets you break them twice<br>
      </div>

      <div id="bridge">
      <br>
      [Bridge]<br>
      Don't pretend that I'm the instigator<br>
      You were the one, but you were born to say goodbye<br>
      Kissed me half a decade later<br>
      That same perfume, those same sad eyes<br>
      </div>

      <div id="finalchorus">
      <br>
      [Chorus]<br>
      Go ahead and break my heart again<br>
      Leave me wonderin' why the hell I ever let you in<br>
      Are you the definition of insanity?<br>
      Or am I?<br>
      Or am I?<br>
      It must be nice<br>
      To love someone who lets you break them twice</p>
